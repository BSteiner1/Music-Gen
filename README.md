# ðŸŽµ Music-Gen

#### A project on Symbolic Music Generation

## â™¯ Part 1: Bach Chorales

* We use the [Bach Doodle Dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/bach-doodle) to generate new four-bar phrases of music.
* User melodies are harmonised in the style of Bach Chorales by [CoCoNet](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet).
* We then train an LSTM-GAN to be able to generate new examples. 


### ðŸ”® For The Future:

#### ðŸ‘€ Latent Feature Personalisation
* We can explore how the latent features affect the characteristics of the music produced.
* This could assist the composer in personalisation of the music.
